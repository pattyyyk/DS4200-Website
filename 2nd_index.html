    <h2>Shooting with a film camera feels like tucking away little pieces of my life into a time capsule. Each roll takes its own journey, from careful shots to the suspense of waiting for development, to finally seeing the images as they come to life in digital form. There's a special thrill in holding those moments in my hands, reliving each one as I flip through the images, giving me a second chance to appreciate and absorb the beauty in those fleeting seconds.
